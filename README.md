This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to predict Formula 1 race lap times based on key race parameters, including fuel load, tire degradation, and track temperature. The model is trained on historical F1 race data and can simulate lap-by-lap performance across different tire compounds (Soft, Medium, and Hard). The objective is to assist race engineers in optimizing race strategies through AI-driven insights.
It is made on flask backend to show graph and compare from the real-world lap time produced. 
The data is from FastF1 API.
